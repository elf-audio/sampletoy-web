# SAMPLETOY WEB

I once made an iOS app called Sampletoy - it used openFrameworks (a C++ creative coding library) to build the UI - this is an attempt to redo the UI in React as a learning exercise and connect it to the C++ audio back-end, and optionally build a web audio version of the audio engine as its quite simple.
